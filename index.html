    <p>The ASRJC ICT Champions programme is an initiative at Anderson Serangoon Junior College in Singapore, aimed at enhancing digital literacy among students. The programme provides students with opportunities to develop and apply their ICT skills through various activities and projects.

This role helps students gain valuable hard and soft skills as well as leadership abilities through experiential learning and service while contributing to the college's digital initiativesâ€‹
